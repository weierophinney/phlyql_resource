Phly\SqliteResource
===================

This is a "toy" library designed to make it easy to prototype persistence for
RESTful APIs. It essentially allows you to create a SQLite database with the
following columns:

- **id**, which represents an identifier. This is autogenerated by the library,
  and will be a 32 character hexidecimal string (i.e. characters 0-9 and a-f).
- **data**, a JSON-encoded string representing a resource. This will always be
  returned as an associative array.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). Download
the composer installer, and create a `composer.json` file as follows:

```json
{
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "require": {
        "phly/sqlite-resource": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer install`.

Schema
------

A schema is available in [schema.sqlite.sql](schema.sqlite.sql). Essentially:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS collection (
    id CHARACTER(32) PRIMARY KEY,
    data BLOB NOT NULL
);
```

Alter it as you see fit to change the table name.

Initialization
--------------

In order to instantiate `Phly\SqliteResource\SqliteResource`, you will need an
instance of PDO. Typical instantiation will look like this:

```php
use PDO;
use Phly\SqliteResource\SqliteResource;

$pdo = new PDO('sqlite:/path/to/database.db');
$resource = new SqliteResource($pdo, 'table-name');
```

API
---

The API supports the following operations:

- **create(array $data)** - Inserts the resource into the database and returns
  it, with a new "id" key with the newly created identifier.
- **fetch($id)** - Fetches the resource with the given identifier. If no
  resource is found, an exception is thrown.
- **fetchAll($limit = null, $offset = null)** - Fetches all resources from the
  database, returning an array of arrays. If a limit is given, returns only the
  number of resources indicated; if an offset is given along with a limit,
  returns resources from that offset
- **patch($id, array $data)** - Merges the provided `$data` with the record that
  already exists in the database identified by `$id` and saves it. The merged
  resource is returned.
- **update($id, array $data)** - Replaces the resource identified by `$id` with
  the `$data`. Returns the resource.
- **delete($id)** - Deletes the resource identified by `$id`.

Caveats
-------

Do not use this in production. Use a document database, or a relational database
with a real schema that maps to the fields in your resources.
